        <h3>TL;DR</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Car is in <u>long term parking</u></li>
            <li>Taking descending escalator nearest to your bag claim should take you to the correct elevator</li>
            <li>Ride elevator to <b>4<sup>th</sup> floor</b></li>
            <li>Turn left twice. <a href="#exit-elevator"> Video</a></li>
            <li>Key under car near driver side rear wheel. <a href="#hide-a-key"> Video</a></li>
            <li>Parking ticket on seat</li>
            <li>Secure object on passenger seat. Recline chair slightly</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 1: Claim luggage</h3>
        <p>Should be easy enough to figure out.
            It should be noted that you will be heading down an escalator. At the bottom of this escalator,
            you should see another escalator that will take you to the <u>Long Term Parking</u>.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Proceed to tunnel to <u>Long Term Parking</u> </h3>
        <p>There should be signs from where you claim your luggage. If my data is correct, and you are at United luggage claim,
        then you would walk back the way you came and turn left to go <b>down</b> the escalator to a long tunnel
        leading to the <u>Long Term Parking</u>.</p>

        <p>See the <a href="#apend">map</a> for additional clarity.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Get on elevator</h3>
        <p>You have arrived at the end of the tunnel and are met by an elevator. You are going to the <b>4<sup>th</sup> floor</b>.</p>

        <h3 id="exit-elevator" >Step 4: Exit elevator</h3>
        <p>Step off the elevator. Turn left twice and you should see the car.</p>

                allow="autoplay; encrypted-media" allowfullscreen></iframe>

        <h3 id="hide-a-key" >Step 5: Retrieve Key</h3>
        <p>Key located under car near driver side rear wheel. See video for additional details.</p>

        <h3>Step 6: Notify me</h3>
            <p>You should now be safe and sound in my vehicle. Please message me and let me know everything went smoothly.</p>

        <h3>Step 7: Prepare to depart</h3>
        <p>There may or may not be something in the passenger seat (ðŸ˜‰). Reclining the passenger chair slightly and leaving
            it there should ensure nothing happens to it.</p>

        <h3>Step 7: Pay Parking ðŸ˜¬</h3>
            <p>If I could have paid in advanced I would have but you have to pay on the way out, I'm sorry!
            By this point I have venmoed you the money to cover the cost.</p>
